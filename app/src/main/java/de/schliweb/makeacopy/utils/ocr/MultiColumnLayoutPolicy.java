 * Policy that detects a multi-column text layout (newspapers, magazines) from the geometry of

 * <p>Background: PaddleOCR emits one {@code RecognizedWord} per detected text line. The default
 * text builder groups boxes into visual lines purely by vertical proximity, which interleaves the
 * lines of side-by-side columns and destroys the text flow. This policy clusters the boxes into
 * columns using their horizontal extent, treats page-wide boxes (headlines, captions) as full-width
 * separators, and returns segments in reading order: full-width band, then the columns of the next
 * band left-to-right (or right-to-left for RTL scripts), each column top-to-bottom.
 *
 * <p>This class is a pure function on box coordinates and intentionally has no Android dependencies
 * so that it is fully covered by JVM unit tests (mirrors {@link VerticalTextLayoutPolicy}).
